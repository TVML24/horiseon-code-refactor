# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to practice and clarify conecpts and understanding related to HTML and CSS by refactoring someone else's code that had been written without semantic elements in mind. It was also to improve on the conciceness of the CSS used to make it easier to understand and make subsequent changes.
This refactoring reinforces best practices in front end development for writing CSS and HTML code; making the page more accessable and more navigable.
This refactor forced me to consider much more at length the wisdom of using the appropriate semantic elements, rather than simply using Divs as well as the importance of testing the links on the webpage even when it seems as though they should be working.

## Usage

This website shows some basic information about a company called Horiseon and gives the user more information about the services that the company provides as well as the benefits the user may encounter should they use these services. The links in the navigation bar at the top will take the user to the appropriate part of the page.

Credit to the original author of the code (whose name I am not aware of).

All of the refactoring, however, is my own work.
